# Muscat Bay Water Management System

## Overview
The Muscat Bay Water Management System is a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for water distribution, consumption analysis, and loss detection across the entire Muscat Bay development. This enhanced system provides detailed insights into water flow from the main bulk supply through zone distribution to end-user consumption, enabling efficient water resource management and loss minimization.

## Features

  - Live system efficiency calculation
  - Intelligent alert system based on loss thresholds

- **Water Loss Analysis**
  - Stage 1 Loss: Trunk main losses (L1 → L2+DC)
  - Stage 2 Loss: Distribution network losses (L2 → L3)
  - Total System Loss with percentage calculations
  - Industry standard compliance indicators

- **Water Distribution Hierarchy**

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard
Navigate to `/water-system` to access the comprehensive water management dashboard.

### Tab Navigation
- **Overview**: System-wide metrics and alerts
- **Zone Analysis**: Individual zone performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical trends and patterns
- **Top Consumers**: Major water users analysis

### Interactive Features
- Period selection (monthly data from 2024-2025)
- Zone filtering and detailed analysis
- Real-time metric calculations
- Responsive design for all devices

## Key Metrics and Calculations

### Water Flow Levels
1. **L1 (Main Bulk)**: Total supply from NAMA main connection
2. **L2 (Zone Bulks)**: Water distributed to individual zones
3. **DC (Direct Connections)**: Hotel, irrigation, and large consumers
4. **L3 (Individual Meters)**: End-user consumption

### Loss Calculations
- **Stage 1 Loss** = L1 - (L2 + DC)
- **Stage 2 Loss** = L2 - L3  
- **Total System Loss** = L1 - (L3 + DC)
- **System Efficiency** = ((L3 + DC) / L1) × 100%

### Alert Thresholds
- **Excellent**: < 20% total loss (Green alert)
- **Acceptable**: 20-30% total loss (Yellow alert)  
- **Critical**: > 30% total loss (Red alert)
- **Negative Loss**: Possible meter calibration issues

## Data Sources
